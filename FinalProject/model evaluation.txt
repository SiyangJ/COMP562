Model Evaluation

We evaluate the prediction model's performance based on four measurements:
normalized mean squared error (NMSE),
mean absolute error (MAE),
root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mutual information (MI).
The training and test set are divided so that data from 2002 to 2017 is training set and data since 2017 is test set.
We also employ bootstrap analysis on assessment of the accuracy of the estimator by random resampling with replacement from an original dataset.
