abstract = "Predicting the direction and movement of stock index prices is difficult, often leading to excessive trading, transaction costs, and missed opportunities. Often traders need a systematic method to not only spot trading opportunities, but to also provide a consistent approach, thereby minimizing trading errors and costs. While mechanical trading systems exist, they are usually designed for a specific stock, stock index, or other financial asset, and are often highly dependent on preselected inputs and model parameters that are expected to continue providing trading information well after the initial training or back-tested model development period. The following research leads to a detailed trading model that provides a more effective and intelligent way for recognizing trading signals and assisting investors with trading decisions by utilizing a system that adapts both the inputs and the prediction model based on the desired output. To illustrate the adaptive approach, multiple inputs and modeling techniques are utilized, including neural networks, particle swarm optimization, and denoising. Simulations with stock indexes illustrate how traders can generate higher returns using the developed adaptive decision support system model. The benefits of adding adaptive and intelligent decision making to forecasts are also discussed."

abstract = "Financial markets are complex systems influenced by many interrelated economic, political and psychological factors and characterised by inherent nonlinearities. Recently, there have been many efforts towards stock market prediction, applying various fuzzy logic techniques and using technical analysis methods. This paper presents a short term trading fuzzy system using a novel trading strategy and an “amalgam” between altered commonly used technical indicators and rarely used ones, in order to assist investors in their portfolio management. The sample consists of daily data from the general index of the Athens Stock Exchange over a period of more than 15 years (15/11/1996 to 5/6/2012), which was also divided into distinctive groups of bull and bear market periods. The results suggest that, with or without taking into consideration transaction costs, the return of the proposed fuzzy model is superior to the returns of the buy and hold strategy. Τhe proposed system can be characterised as conservative, since it produces smaller losses during bear market periods and smaller gains during bull market periods compared with the buy and hold strategy."

abstract = "In financial markets, it is both important and challenging to forecast the daily direction of the stock market return. Among the few studies that focus on predicting daily stock market returns, the data mining procedures utilized are either incomplete or inefficient, especially when a large amount of features are involved. This paper presents a complete and efficient data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) return based on 60 financial and economic features. Three mature dimensionality reduction techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), fuzzy robust principal component analysis (FRPCA), and kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA) are applied to the whole data set to simplify and rearrange the original data structure. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data using each of the three different dimensionality reduction methods. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are then used with the thirty-six transformed data sets for classification to forecast the daily direction of future market returns. Moreover, the three different dimensionality reduction methods are compared with respect to the natural data set. A group of hypothesis tests are then performed over the classification and simulation results to show that combining the ANNs with the PCA gives slightly higher classification accuracy than the other two combinations, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive classification mining procedures based on PCA and ANNs gain significantly higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, while also being slightly higher than those strategies guided by the forecasts based on the FRPCA and KPCA models."

abstract = {"For many years, how to make stock market predictions has been a prevalent research topic. To carry out accurate forecasting, stock analysts and academic researchers have tried various analysis techniques, algorithms, and models. For example, "technical analysis” is a popular approach used by common stock investors to analyze market trend, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GAs), neural network (NN), and fuzzy time-series (FTS), were proposed by researchers to forecast the future stock index. Although the daily forecasts are very useful for professional investors who implement intraday trading, we argue that forecasting a bullish turning point is a more interesting issue than the future stock index for common investor because an accurate forecast will bring a huge amount of stock return. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent pattern recognition model, based on two new stock pattern recognition methods, “PIP bull-flag pattern matching” and the “floating-weighted bull-flag template,” to recognize a bull-flag stock pattern. The bull-flag pattern is a stock's turning point with proper timing, which can enable a stock investor to profit. To promote recognition accuracy, the proposed model employs chart patterns and technical indicators, simultaneously, as pattern recognition factors. In the model verification, we evaluate the proposed model with stock returns by forecasting two stock databases (TAIEX and NASDAQ), and comparing the returns with other advanced algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the published algorithms, such as rough set theory (RST), genetic algorithms (GAs) and their hybrid model, and gives a high-level of profitability. Additionally, the trading strategies, provided by the proposed model, also help investors to make beneficial investment decisions in the stock market."}
